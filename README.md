# SkyAR
a vision-based method for video sky replacement and harmonization, which can automatically generate realistic and dramatic sky backgrounds in videos with controllable styles. Different from previous sky editing methods that either focus on static photos or require inertial measurement units integrated in smartphones on shooting videos, our method is purely vision-based, without any requirements on the capturing devices, and can be well applied to either online or offline processing scenarios.
